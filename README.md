# recipes 🎉

A new Flutter project.

Recipes is a simpler starter/beginner flutter project where we
learn everything is a widget, fiddle with them, give them some state
and mutate the state like a bad genetic mutation. Sometimes we get
good, beautiful results from the state mutations, but mostly a monster is
born as a result of the mutations.

What can I say?! 🤷🏽‍♂️

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
